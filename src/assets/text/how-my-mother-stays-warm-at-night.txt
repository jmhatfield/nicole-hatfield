<p>She soaks in the hot tub<br/>
that occupies the majority of our small deck.<br/>
One of her hands heats the glass of cheap wine<br/>
while she concentrates on keeping the other hand hovering<br/>
just above the surface.<br/>The moon is almost orange<br/>
and hangs low dripping light into the sky<br/>
as if her scene is a picture developing under<br/>
the lights and shadows of time. Floating alone<br/>
in the hot bubbles that peel away at her feet, tired soles<br/>
stretch towards the ends of the tub and her bloated stomach<br/>
surfaces like an island. She is alone, she smiles<br/>
up at the stars as if they are whispering <em>you are beautiful</em>.<br/>
She gives in to this small square of the universe<br/>
where breathing lapses<br/>and the body lies unjudged<br/>
in a suit of spandex sinking<br/>
into black skies. Backyard shadows<br/>
of the deteriorating shed remind her of how wooden planks<br/>
wedged themselves between her marriage.<br/>
She doesn't know how love is supposed to age,<br/>
but her husband keeps the hot tub chemicals<br/>
in balance and the shed gets moldier each year.<br/>
She shuts her eyes so she won't have to look<br/>
at old skeleton trees slicing through<br/>
moon-washed memories.<br/>
She forgets what it's like to rest<br/>
a chubby toddler on her boney hip.<br/>
She drowns polaroid pictures in the tub:<br/>
waterlogging memories of when womanhood<br/>
looked flattering on her.</p>
