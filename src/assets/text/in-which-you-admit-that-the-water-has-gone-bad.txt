<p>With your toes breaching the surface<br/>
of the pond behind your house, you feel<br/>
rotten water, dark muck slick with shit<br/>
and chewed bubble gum. The pond is crammed<br/>
with debris and broken needles, stinging sounds<br/>
and greasy bubbles. The word eutrophication comes to mind,<br/>
then utero. Then body, then fluid, then dense,<br/>
but dead. Feet sucked into mud, you look<br/>
like something wild. The black yolks of tadpole eggs<br/>
find your eyes as you stare into the pond<br/>
and think about the water turning your feet<br/>
green and how in the moment<br/>
you may look like a girl emptied<br/>
and refilled with dead leaves; I mean,<br/>
like a thing reborn.</p>
