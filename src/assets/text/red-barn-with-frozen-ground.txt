<p>The night wind throws the stars across a winter sky<br/>
and the earth is hard and the horses<br/>
are hungry, but beautiful.<br/>
Their noses are soft. I am comfortable.<br/>
My fingers like cold carrots<br/>
as I soak sweet grain in warm water<br/>
for the gelding kicking at his door.<br/>
He will die a retired horse:<br/>
I watch him eat.<br/>
His old bones have carried so many children,<br/>
his teeth are weak from years of chewing,<br/>
He throws his body against the stall door,<br/>
my shivering turns into sweating<br/>
and the night into morning.<br/>
My ungloved hands reach down his choking throat<br/>
and feel darkness, his glands swell<br/>
like night swallowing a city street,<br/>
but I am alone, and the sedatives in another room.<br/>
This animal moans but no sound resonates<br/>
because I cry and the birds sing<br/>
into the space between my lungs.<br/>
I don't leave his stall<br/>
until the barn cat crawls over my still body<br/>
and her empty stomach echoes into me.</p>
