<p>Top off your glass.<br/>
Smear the condensing wet<br/>
onto a stained towel.<br/>
Groove into the music and brace<br/>
the groove of the glass between<br/>
parted lips so that pity spills<br/>
like a party meant for the block.<br/>
Trip on bottles bought from desperation<br/>
and steal mistakes from slurring ancestors.<br/>
Take a shot and see snot run down<br/>
your nose: you have your father's nose.<br/>
Pour champagne over family photos.<br/>
White faces glowing, teeth stained,<br/>
waiting for numb to reach their guts.<br/>
Take a piss in your jeans,<br/>
brighten your eyes with a splash<br/>
of vodka. You are glimmering.<br/>
Raise your head and suck down<br/>
the sadness like an adult.<br/>
You are singing<br/>
a sparkling tune, drunk<br/>
on the vision of a fetus<br/>
swimming in a crystal glass.</p>
