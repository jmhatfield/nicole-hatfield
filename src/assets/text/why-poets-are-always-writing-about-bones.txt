<p>It is something about the fragility of bone, swollen white shattering into curved sharps<br/>
and soft life. It's like dancing naked, when you could catch fire by running<br/>
a fingernail along your collarbone. Something with nourishment and bereavement,<br/>
burned mouths and salt-licked palms pressed against a world of bones, still sanctified.<br/>
It's like when the poet goes to the graveyard to hear wind throw itself against stone.<br/>
Or whistles through their teeth to hush the wind and rattle the space<br/>
between teeth and bone. It's the soul in disguise, isn't it? When the mother builds<br/>
a home out of dead words and imagines it can raise a baby. Holds it between<br/>
cracked coos and warm flesh greased in tallow. A bone out of body, something<br/>
hallowed and picked clean, something carved out of tenderness.</p>
